===== DON'T JUGE THIS PIECE OF CODE =====

This was the first real thing I wrote in C, so the code is absolutely horrible.
Originally I wrote this game using cc65 and Windows XP in april/may 2022 in
approximately 10 days.
This version is made to be compiled with llvm-mos.
For this version I just used the code of main.c in the version of the 04/05/2022
and fixed the includes.
Originally I used Apha.chr by nesdoug, but for this version I used my own chr
file with characters.
